### How to contribute without using Pixilart

Without Pixilart you can use whatever software you want but the ***canvas size must be 32x32***

After making changes or adding new emoji make sure to add the pixel image in `./emojis` directory not in `./pixilart/emojis` directory.


## Naming Pixel Emoji files and folders  üìÅ
***Make sure to name the files using `-`, do not use spaces or underscores `_`.***

## In Brief : Pixel Images Director
- If you are contributing using Pixilart then paste the image in `./pixilart/emojis` only and the `.pixil` file in `./pixilart/pixil-files`.
- If you are contributing without using Pixilart (any other software) then paste the image in the `./emojis` only.
